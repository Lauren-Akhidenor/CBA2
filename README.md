## Project Overview
This project evaluates the **economic viability** of cultivating **Amaranth** and **Corchorus** under two farming systems:

- **Project 1:** Organic farming using only manure.  
- **Project 2:** Integrated farming combining fertiliser, pesticide, and manure.  

The study compares costs, revenues, and profitability using structured **economic analysis** to inform smallholder farming decisions in Nigeria.

---

## Economic Methodology
The project applies **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** combined with standard economic metrics for investment appraisal:

- **Net Benefit:** Total Revenue − Total Cost  
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** (Net Benefit ÷ Total Cost) × 100  
- **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR):** Total Revenue ÷ Total Cost  
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** ∑ (Net Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t) − Initial Investment  
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** Discount rate at which NPV = 0  

**Purpose:** To quantify economic efficiency and determine which farming system provides greater profitability and financial sustainability.  

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel

## Key Findings Summary  

**Clear Economic Winner: Organic Farming**

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Organic | Integrated | Advantage |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **ROI** | **+19.9%** | -18.4% | Organic outperforms by **38.3 percentage points** |
| **Benefit–Cost Ratio (BCR)** | **1.20** | 0.82 | Only organic exceeds the profitability threshold (1.0) |
| **Net Present Value (NPV)** | **₦3,755** | -₦13,268 | Organic generates positive economic value |
| **Net Benefit** | **₦8,300** | -₦9,450 | **₦17,750 higher profit per cycle** under organic |

## Critical Policy Implications

### Why Integrated Farming Failed
- **Higher production costs** (₦51,450 vs ₦41,700) without proportional yield gains  
- **Lower amaranth yield** (120 kg vs 150 kg under organic management)  
- **Pesticides and fertilizers increased costs** without improving productivity or market value  

---

## Recommended Actions

- **Scale organic African Leafy Vegetable (ALV) production** as a proven, profitable enterprise for smallholders  
- **Reassess integrated input protocols**, the current model is economically destructive  
- **Lower manure costs** (₦25,000 = ~60% of organic costs) through **community composting and shared input systems**  
- **Prioritise women and youth** for enterprise development due to low capital requirements and high returns  

---

##  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Alignment

- **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger:** Higher and more stable yields under organic systems  
- **SDG 8 – Decent Work & Economic Growth:** 19.9% ROI enables viable farm-based livelihoods  
- **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption & Production:** Reduced chemical dependency  
- **SDG 15 – Life on Land:** Improved soil health and ecological sustainability
